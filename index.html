    <p id="landing-text">I'm a dedicated QA Engineer with over 9 years of experience, currently expanding my expertise into Web Development and QA Automation. My professional journey has equipped me with strong skills in quality assurance, test case development, and implementing effective QA methodologies.
        With a passion for creating robust digital solutions, I've successfully developed several web applications including a comprehensive text analytics tool and a custom automotive client portal. My technical foundation in quality engineering combined with growing front-end development skills allows me to build applications with quality and user experience at the forefront.
        I excel in cross-functional team environments, having served as a point of contact for partner studios globally and collaborating with leads to establish team OKRs. My experience spans multiple platforms including PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Stadia, giving me versatile insights into various development ecosystems.
        Currently seeking opportunities that leverage both my QA engineering expertise and web development skills, I'm particularly interested in roles that involve test automation, front-end development, or a hybrid of both disciplines. My goal is to contribute to projects where quality and innovation intersect, creating exceptional digital experiences through meticulous testing and thoughtful development.

            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            <p>This portfolio — the one you are currently viewing — is also counted as one of my projects. It was a personal challenge I set for myself: to build a visually appealing portfolio that could also serve as a CV by using basic HTML & CSS. The project can easily be explored by simply scrolling through the page. Its main purpose is to provide a front-end showcase of my skills and experience.</p>
