    <p id="landing-text">I'm a dedicated QA Engineer with over 9 years of experience, currently expanding my expertise into Web Development and QA Automation. My journey has equipped me with strong foundations in quality assurance, test case design, and implementing scalable QA methodologies.
    I've built several web applications including a powerful text analysis tool and a client portal for automotive services. These projects combine my testing background with a growing front-end skillset, focusing on both performance and usability.
    My collaborative style, ability to lead cross-functional teams, and experience across platforms like PlayStation, Xbox, and PC fuel my passion for high-quality digital solutions. I’m currently exploring roles where quality engineering and web development intersect to deliver robust and user-centric applications.

    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
    <p>This website you're currently viewing is one of my personal projects — a fully custom-built portfolio created entirely with just <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>. I developed it to challenge myself and see how far I could go without using any JavaScript or frameworks.</p>
    <p>It serves a dual purpose: as a <strong>digital CV</strong> and a <strong>front-end showcase</strong>. The project emphasizes clean structure, responsive design, and fast performance. Every section — from the layout and modals to the grid and typography — was hand-crafted to reflect my focus on building functional and accessible user interfaces with a minimalist tech stack.</p>

    <h2>WordCounter</h2>
    <p><strong>WordCounter</strong> is a powerful, web-based text analysis tool I developed to help writers, editors, and QA specialists. It offers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Instant word and character counting</li>
      <li>Readability metrics (e.g. Flesch-Kincaid scores)</li>
      <li>Keyword density analysis and phrase frequency insights</li>
      <li>AI-generated content detection for originality checks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Designed with a clean, intuitive interface, it provides fast feedback to boost writing clarity and quality. It was built using front-end fundamentals and optimized with user experience at heart.</p>
    <p> The project can be viewed on GitHub, and the source code is available on my GitHub profile or at <a href="https://textanalyticspro.online/">this link</a>. It's a great example of how I can apply my QA skills
    to build a functional web application from scratch.</p>
